# Ring of Fire

Time-travel visualization of seismic events, using data from USGS.

Very much a WIP. The data needs of the frontend are fairly basic, so I'm using this as an opportunity to try out some backends that I haven't worked with too much before. Currently there are 3 backends, I'm building them all concurrently, and they'll eventually return the same data, so they're interchangeable to the frontend.

Backends:
    - Hasura GraphQL API
    - Python/Flask REST API
    - Simple Golang backend
